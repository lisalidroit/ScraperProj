# Scraper Testing Project



The purpose of this project is to provide infrastructure which allows for better, automated testing of the droit scraper. 
This is done by creating a static website which hosts some sample data and typical features you would find when scraping a regulatory website.

This includes paginated tables, download links etc. 

To run the server, navigate to the scraper testing directory and type `lein run` in terminal. 
Then head to `http://localhost:8080` to display the website.
